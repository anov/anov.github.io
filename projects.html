		<h4>Predicting Public Opinion in 140 Characters or Less</h4>
		<p>
			I'm working on an interdisciplinary project in Political Science and Computer Science, seeking to address whether Twitter can tell us something about public opinion, and how public opinion expressed on Twitter compare to traditional public polling? 
			Code for the project lives on <a href='http://github.com/anov/honors'> Github</a>.
			I began the project working in Python and planning on using nltk and R for the machine learning and stat-crunching aspects of the project, respectively. I ended up migrating to an entirely Python-based stack including <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/index.html">pandas</a>, <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/">scikit-learn</a>, and <a href=""> statsmodels</a>, with a workflow that made increasing use of IPython.

			Data<br/>
			Will be available here as soon as I push it to S3.
