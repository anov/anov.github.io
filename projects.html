				I'm working on an interdisciplinary project in Political Science and Computer Science right now. My fundamental question is this: can Twitter tell us something about public opinion, and how does it compare to traditional public polling? 
				Code for the project lives on <a href='http://github.com/anov/honors'> Github</a>.
				I began the project working in Python and planning on using nltk and R for the machine learning and stat-crunching aspects of the project, respectively. I ended up migrating to an entirely Python-based stack including <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/index.html">pandas</a>, <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/">scikit-learn</a>, and <a href=""> statsmodels</a>, with a workflow that made increasing use of IPython.

				Data<br/>
				Will be available here as soon as I push it to S3.
